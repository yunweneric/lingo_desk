# LingoDesk: Localization Management Tool

LingoDesk is a lightweight, project-based translation manager designed to eliminate the manual overhead of syncing multiple JSON localization files. It provides a centralized UI to manage keys and translations across various languages with real-time progress tracking.

Built with **Flutter** for web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

## 🚀 The Problem

Developers often spend excessive time manually opening, editing, and syncing key-value pairs across `en.json`, `es.json`, `uk.json`, etc. This process is:

- **Error-prone**: Easy to miss keys or make typos
- **Time-consuming**: Requires opening multiple files and manually syncing
- **Inefficient**: Breaks the development flow and reduces productivity

## ✨ The Solution

LingoDesk offers a cross-platform workflow to:

- **Organize translations by "App" (Project)**: Group related translations together
- **Flatten complex nested JSON**: Convert nested structures into a manageable table format
- **Track translation completion**: Real-time progress percentages for each language
- **Export clean, nested JSON**: Generate production-ready files with proper structure

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter (Web, Desktop, Mobile)
- **Version Management**: FVM (Flutter Version Management)
- **State Management**: BLoC (Business Logic Component)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
- **Storage**: Local storage (Hive/SharedPreferences)

## 🏗 Architecture

LingoDesk follows **Clean Architecture** principles with **BLoC** state management, organized in a **feature-based** folder structure.

### Clean Architecture Layers

```
lib/
├── core/                    # Core functionality
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── errors/
│   ├── usecases/
│   ├── utils/

│   │       │   └── export.dart    # Barrel file
│   │       ├── pages/
│   │       │   └── export.dart    # Barrel file
│   │       ├── widgets/
│   │       │   └── export.dart    # Barrel file
│   │       └── export.dart        # Main presentation barrel
│   ├── app_settings/
│   ├── file_upload/
│   └── translation_editor/
└── main.dart
```

> **Note**: Each feature uses barrel files (`export.dart`) for clean imports. See [Feature Implementation Guide](docs/feature.md#barrel-files) for details.

### Layer Responsibilities

- **Presentation Layer**: UI, BLoC, Pages, Widgets
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, Entities, Use cases, Repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Data sources, Models, Repository implementations

### BLoC State Management

Each feature uses BLoC pattern for state management:

```
feature/
└── presentation/
    └── bloc/
        ├── feature_bloc.dart
        ├── feature_event.dart
        └── feature_state.dart
```

## 📱 Application Flow

LingoDesk follows a 4-screen flow designed for an intuitive translation management experience.

### 1. App Management Dashboard

The entry point of the application.

- **CRUD for Apps**: Create, view, update, or delete localization projects
- **Persistence**: Project metadata is saved to local storage so your project list persists across sessions
- **Overview**: See high-level completion status for each app

### 2. App Settings

Configure the specific requirements for an App.

- **Source Language**: Set the base language (e.g., `en`)
- **Target Languages**: Define languages to translate into (e.g., `uk`, `es`, `ru`)
- **Project Configuration**: Update project naming and language scope

### 3. File Initialization (Upload)

A dedicated stage to sync your local code with the editor.

- **Context-Aware**: Displays the specific languages required for the selected App
- **Validation**: Ensures files match the expected language codes before proceeding
- **File Upload**: Import existing JSON files to populate the editor

### 4. Translation Editor (The Workspace)

The core engine of LingoDesk.

- **Flattened Grid**: A unified table where each row is a translation key
- **Progress Widget**: Real-time completion bars for every target language
- **"Show Missing Only"**: A filter to instantly isolate untranslated strings
- **CRUD on Keys**: Add new keys or delete obsolete ones across all languages simultaneously
- **JSON Export**: Re-constructs the nested JSON structure and triggers downloads

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications

### Data Transformation

**Flattening**: Converts nested JSON into dot-notation format

```json
// Input
{
  "nav": {
    "home": "Home"
  }
}

// Output
{
  "nav.home": "Home"
}
```

**Un-flattening**: Reverses dot-notation back into deep objects upon export

**In-Memory State**: Translation content is handled in-session for maximum speed and privacy

### Core Features

- **Missing Indicator**: Automatic UI highlighting for empty fields
- **Confirmation Guards**: Destructive actions (deleting keys or apps) are protected by warning modals
- **Frontend-Only**: No backend required. Your data stays locally

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing setup for unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests.

## 📦 Building

### Local Build

```bash
# Web
fvm flutter build web

# Desktop (macOS)
fvm flutter build macos

# Desktop (Linux)
fvm flutter build linux

# Desktop (Windows)
fvm flutter build windows

# Mobile (iOS)
fvm flutter build ios

# Mobile (Android)
fvm flutter build apk
# or
fvm flutter build appbundle
```

### CI/CD Builds & Artifacts

APKs are automatically built and uploaded as artifacts when code is pushed to `main` or when a version tag is created.

**Downloading from GitHub Releases (Recommended):**

When you create a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`), a GitHub Release is automatically created with APK files attached:

1. Go to the **Releases** page in your GitHub repository
2. Find the release version you want
3. Download the APK files from the **Assets** section:
   - **`app-release.apk`** - Release APK (recommended for testing)
   - **`app-debug.apk`** - Debug APK
   - **`app-release.aab`** - App Bundle for Google Play Store (if available)

**Downloading from Workflow Artifacts:**

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the latest **"Build Android APK"** workflow run
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section
4. Download the desired artifact:
   - **`lingodesk-release-apk`** - Release APK (recommended for testing)
   - **`lingodesk-debug-apk`** - Debug APK
   - **`lingodesk-release-bundle`** - App Bundle for Google Play Store

**Creating a Release:**

To create a new release, create and push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger the build workflow and automatically create a GitHub Release with the APK files attached.

**Artifact Retention:** 
- **Releases**: Permanent (available indefinitely)
- **Workflow Artifacts**: 90 days
