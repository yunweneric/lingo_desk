LingoDesk: Localization Management ToolLingoDesk is a lightweight, project-based translation manager designed to eliminate the manual overhead of syncing multiple JSON localization files. It provides a centralized UI to manage keys and translations across various languages with real-time progress tracking.🚀 The ProblemDevelopers often spend excessive time manually opening, editing, and syncing key-value pairs across en.json, es.json, uk.json, etc. This process is error-prone, leads to missing translations, and breaks the development flow.✨ The SolutionLingoDesk offers a browser-based workflow to:Organize translations by "App" (Project).Flatten complex nested JSON into a manageable table.Track translation completion percentages in real-time.Export clean, nested JSON files ready for production.🛠 Project Architecture (4-Screen Flow)1. App Management DashboardThe entry point of the application.CRUD for Apps: Create, view, update, or delete localization projects.Persistence: Project metadata is saved to localStorage so your project list persists across sessions.Overview: See high-level completion status for each app.2. App SettingsConfigure the specific requirements for an App.Set the Source Language (e.g., en).Define Target Languages (e.g., uk, es, ru).Update project naming and language scope.3. File Initialization (Upload)A dedicated stage to sync your local code with the editor.Context-Aware: Displays the specific languages required for the selected App.Validation: Ensures files match the expected language codes before proceeding.4. Translation Editor (The Workspace)The core engine of LingoDesk.Flattened Grid: A unified table where each row is a translation key.Progress Widget: Real-time completion bars for every target language."Show Missing Only": A filter to instantly isolate untranslated strings.CRUD on Keys: Add new keys or delete obsolete ones across all languages simultaneously.JSON Export: Re-constructs the nested JSON structure and triggers browser downloads.⚙️ Technical SpecificationsData TransformationFlattening: Converts {"nav": {"home": "Home"}} → "nav.home": "Home".Un-flattening: Reverses dot-notation back into deep objects upon export.In-Memory State: Translation content is handled in-session for maximum speed and privacy.Core FeaturesMissing Indicator: Automatic UI highlighting for empty fields.Confirmation Guards: Destructive actions (deleting keys or apps) are protected by warning modals.Frontend-Only: No backend required. Your data stays in your browser.🚦 Getting StartedDefine an App: Create your first project and set your target languages.Upload Files: Drop your existing .json files into the uploader.Translate: Use the "Show Missing" filter to fill in the gaps.Export: Download the updated files and drop them back into your codebase.LingoDesk was prototyped and specified using an iterative blueprinting process to ensure a rock-solid development path.
